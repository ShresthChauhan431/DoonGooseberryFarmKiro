There's something magical about transforming fresh, ripe fruits into delicious jams. At Doon Gooseberry Farm, jam-making is both an art and a science, combining traditional techniques with modern food safety standards.

## The Seasonal Approach

### Why Seasonal Matters

We only make jams when fruits are at their peak ripeness. This means:

- **Maximum flavor**: Ripe fruits have the best taste
- **Natural sweetness**: Less added sugar needed
- **Higher nutrients**: Peak ripeness means peak nutrition
- **Supporting local**: We use fruits from our farm and neighboring organic farms

### Our Seasonal Calendar

**Spring (March-May)**
- Strawberry jam
- Mixed berry jam
- Apricot jam

**Summer (June-August)**
- Mango jam
- Peach jam
- Plum jam

**Monsoon (September-October)**
- Gooseberry jam
- Apple jam

**Winter (November-February)**
- Orange marmalade
- Mixed fruit jam

## The Traditional Process

### Step 1: Fruit Selection

Every morning during harvest season, our team hand-picks fruits at their perfect ripeness. We look for:

- Vibrant color
- Firm texture
- Sweet aroma
- No blemishes or damage

### Step 2: Preparation

Within hours of harvest, fruits are:

1. Washed thoroughly in filtered water
2. Sorted and inspected
3. Peeled and deseeded (if needed)
4. Cut into uniform pieces

### Step 3: Cooking

This is where tradition meets precision:

```javascript
// Our jam-making ratio (simplified)
const jamRecipe = {
  fruit: "1 kg",
  sugar: "600-800g (depending on fruit sweetness)",
  lemon: "2 tablespoons juice",
  pectin: "natural (from fruit) or added if needed"
};
```

We cook in small batches using copper pots, which distribute heat evenly and help achieve the perfect consistency.

### Step 4: Testing for Doneness

We use the traditional "wrinkle test":

1. Place a small amount on a cold plate
2. Wait 30 seconds
3. Push with your finger
4. If it wrinkles, it's ready!

### Step 5: Bottling

Hot jam is immediately poured into sterilized glass jars, sealed, and allowed to cool naturally. This creates a vacuum seal that preserves the jam without artificial preservatives.

## What Makes Our Jams Special

### No Artificial Additives

Our jams contain only:

- Fresh fruits
- Sugar (we use organic cane sugar)
- Lemon juice
- Natural pectin (when needed)

That's it! No artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives.

### Low Sugar Content

Because we use perfectly ripe fruits, we need less sugar than commercial jams. Our jams typically contain 30-40% less sugar than store-bought varieties.

### Chunky Texture

We prefer a chunky, rustic texture that lets you taste real fruit pieces. No smooth, processed texture here!

### Small Batch Quality

We make jam in small batches of 10-15 jars at a time. This ensures:

- Consistent quality
- Better flavor control
- Fresher product
- Personal attention to detail

## Popular Varieties

Our signature jam! Made with farm-grown gooseberries, it has a unique tart-sweet flavor that's perfect on toast or as a cake filling.
