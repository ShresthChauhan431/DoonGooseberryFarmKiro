Gooseberry chutney, also known as amla chutney, is a traditional Indian condiment that combines the tartness of fresh gooseberries with aromatic spices. This recipe has been passed down through generations at Doon Gooseberry Farm, and we're excited to share it with you.

## Why Gooseberries?

Gooseberries are packed with Vitamin C and antioxidants, making them not just delicious but incredibly nutritious. Our farm-grown gooseberries are harvested at peak ripeness to ensure maximum flavor and nutritional value.

## Ingredients

- 500g fresh gooseberries (amla)
- 2 tablespoons mustard oil
- 1 teaspoon mustard seeds
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 2-3 dried red chilies
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1 teaspoon red chili powder
- 2 tablespoons jaggery (adjust to taste)
- Salt to taste
- A pinch of asafoetida (hing)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Gooseberries

Wash the gooseberries thoroughly and pat them dry. Remove any stems and cut them into small pieces, discarding the seeds.

### Step 2: Temper the Spices

Heat mustard oil in a pan until it starts smoking. Reduce the heat and add mustard seeds. When they start to splutter, add cumin seeds, dried red chilies, and asafoetida.

### Step 3: Cook the Chutney

Add the chopped gooseberries to the pan. Stir well and cook on medium heat for 5-7 minutes until the gooseberries soften.

Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Mix well and cook for another 3-4 minutes.

### Step 4: Add Sweetness

Add jaggery and stir until it melts and combines with the chutney. Cook for 2-3 more minutes until the chutney reaches your desired consistency.

### Step 5: Cool and Store

Let the chutney cool completely before transferring it to a clean, dry glass jar. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

## Serving Suggestions

This gooseberry chutney pairs wonderfully with:

- Hot parathas or rotis
- Steamed rice and dal
- As a side with your favorite Indian snacks
- Mixed with yogurt for a tangy raita

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use fresh gooseberries**: The fresher the gooseberries, the better the flavor. Our farm delivers within 24 hours of harvest.

2. **Adjust sweetness**: Depending on the tartness of your gooseberries, you may need to adjust the amount of jaggery.

3. **Storage**: Always use a clean, dry spoon when serving to prevent spoilage.

4. **Variations**: Add a handful of fresh curry leaves during tempering for an extra layer of flavor.
